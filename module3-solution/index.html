            <p><br><b>Branches of Philosophy</b><br>
                There are 7 branches of Philosophy, namely, Metaphysics, Axiology, Logic, Aesthetics,
                Epistemology, Ethics and Political Philosophy. Philosophy is the study of the search for
                the truth and equally an effort to know the hidden realities truths about ourselves. As an
                academic discipline, Philosophy is hardly any different. Students who are in Philosophy
                programs are engaged in a pursuit of asking, answering, and resolving problems. In a
                sense, Philosophy is a type of Science, a reservoir of knowledge that can only be
                understood through rigorous investigation and study. Read this blog to know all about
                these branches of Philosophy, the nature of philosophy and more!MA

                What are the 7 Branches of Philosophy?
                To unburden a student from the discouraging task of going through fat books and dense
                literature on every concept of Philosophy, experts of this field came up with the idea of
                creating various branches of Philosophy. In this blog, we have collated a list of major
                and much-discussed branches of Philosophy, which have triggered some famous
                debates in this field. <br>Here are the 7 main branches of Philosophy:
                <br> 1. Axiology
                <br>2. Metaphysics
                <br>3. Epistemology
                <br>4. Ethics
                <br>5. Aesthetics
                <br>6. Logic
                <br>7. Political Philosophy
                <br>Let’s now explore some of these branches of Philosophy in detail.
                <br>Axiology
                <br>Also referred to as the theory of value, Axiology explores the nature of value and its
                metaphysical aspects. Value Theory is often interchangeably used as Axiology and this
                branch of Philosophy peruses upon the value of goodness. To put it simply, Axiology
                looks at the concept of value in terms of its philosophical terms and argues questions
                about nature and what actually is valued.
                <br>Metaphysics
                <br>Metaphysics has been a primary area of philosophical debate. It is mainly concerned
                with explaining the nature of being and the world. Traditionally, it has two different study
                areas, including Cosmology and Ontology. Cosmology is focused on understanding the
                origin, evolution, and the eventual fate of the universe, which include laws that keep it in
                perfect order. On the other hand, Ontology investigates various types of things that exist
                and their relationship with each other. Much before the discovery of modern science, all
                the science-related questions were asked as a part of Metaphysics.
                <br>Epistemology
                <br>Another major component of Philosophy is Epistemology. Going back into history, this
                term originated from the Greek word episteme which literally means knowledge, and the
                other half of the word ‘logy means ‘the study of’. Basically it is about the study of
                knowledge. What can we know? A fundamental question concerning Epistemology is,
                <br>what is knowledge?<br> It also asks questions like, can knowledge ever be absolute?<br> Is
                there a limit for humans to know certain things?<br> If we are living in a world of simulation,
                how can we know it? These are some of the essential questions Epistemology seeks
                answers for.
                <br>Ethics<br>
                Everyone in their day to day life tries to conduct themselves according to some
                established ethical norms. This philosophical concept has different applications in a
                person’s real life. For instance, there are certain organizations that have ethical
                committees which lay down rules of behaviour for its employees. Ethics is concerned
                with the definition of right and wrong. It elucidates schools of thought that instruct us
                how to act in a given situation, which has always been a matter of contention between
                philosophers. Every philosopher has defined it according to their own subjective
                understanding.
                <br>Political Philosophy<br>
                Combining the two fields of Politics and Philosophy, Political Philosophy studies political
                government, laws, liberty, justice, rights, authority, political states and systems, ethics,
                and more. It explores the concepts of why we need governments, the role of played by
                governments, what are its constituents, amongst others.
                <br>Aesthetics<br>
                Every person defines beauty as per his or her own perspectives. This philosophical
                subject is wholly devoted to defining the different aspects of beauty, even its contours.
                How do we find something beautiful? Is beauty always subjective or can it be objective
                too? Can everyone find a thing beautiful? It also examines individual taste and attempts
                to provide answers about these things in a scientific manner. Aesthetic Philosophy’s
                primary topic of investigation is beauty and art. It is often debated inside its classrooms.
                It also talks about performing arts like music.Best Philosophy Books of All Time
                <br>Logic<br>
                We use this word in our commonplace conversations, so we are all aptly familiar with it.
                People constantly ask each other, “where is the logic behind this or that?”. People even
                acknowledge a good thought or act by calling it logically correct. Hence, the question
                arises, what does Science of logic has to do with Philosophy? In logic, we usually
                construct two sentences which are called premises, and they are used to make a
                conclusion. This sort of logic is called a syllogism, pioneered by Aristotle.
                <br>Nature of Philosophy<br>
                The literal meaning of Philosophy is the ‘love of wisdom’ and it enquires into the human
                reality finding rational conception of our being. The nature of philosophy can be said to
                be purely scientific as it incorporates curious discovery of human reality and integrates
                with other sciences like Psychology, Sociology, Physics, Political Science, amongst
                others to understand various philosophical questions. Through the 7 branches of
                Philosophy, i.e. Metaphysics, Axiology, Epistemology, Logic, Ethics, Political Philosophy
                and Aesthetics, it sets out to harmonize sciences to understand the human mind and
                the world.</p>
